# Heart Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model for heart disease detection using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately classify whether a patient has heart disease based on a set of clinical features. The algorithms used in this project include:

- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- Random Forest

## Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and prevention. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to build a model that can predict the presence of heart disease with high accuracy.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease dataset, which contains several clinical features related to heart health. 
The target variable is a binary classification indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

### 1. Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a simple yet powerful linear model for binary classification tasks. It estimates the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to implement and interpret.
  - Requires fewer computational resources.
  - Works well with linearly separable data.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
  - Can be less accurate with complex datasets.

### 2. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting algorithm that provides efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosted trees.

- **Advantages**:
  - High performance and speed.
  - Handles missing data well.
  - Regularization to prevent overfitting.
  - Supports parallel and distributed computing.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can be computationally expensive.
  - Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.

### 3. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes for classification.

- **Advantages**:
  - Handles large datasets with higher dimensionality.
  - Reduces overfitting by averaging the results.
  - Works well with both categorical and numerical features.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can be slower to train compared to single decision trees.
  - Model interpretability can be lower due to the complexity of multiple trees.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing


### 2. Model Training


### 3. Model Evaluation


### 4. Model Deployment


## Results

The performance of each model will be evaluated and compared. The best-performing model will be selected based on evaluation metrics, and its results will be reported.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms for heart disease detection. By comparing Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest, we aim to identify the most accurate and efficient model for predicting heart disease. Early detection through such predictive models can significantly contribute to better treatment and prevention strategies, ultimately saving lives.
